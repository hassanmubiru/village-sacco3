# 🚨 FOUND THE ISSUE!

## Problem Identified:
```
Middleware dashboard check - User: undefined Path: /dashboard
No user found for dashboard, redirecting to login
```

## Root Cause:
1. ✅ **Login works** - Redux state updated, user role = "member"
2. ✅ **Redirect attempted** - "Redirecting to /dashboard" logged
3. ❌ **Middleware blocks** - can't see authenticated user session
4. 🔄 **Stuck in redirect loop** - back to login page

## 🔧 The Fix Applied:
- **Increased redirect delay to 1 second** to allow session establishment
- **Changed back to `window.location.href`** for full page reload
- **This forces proper session cookie setting**

## 🧪 Test This:

1. **Try logging in again** 
2. **Wait for the 1-second delay**
3. **Should redirect properly now**

If this doesn't work, the issue is session cookie configuration between client and middleware.

## 🎯 Backup Plan:
If still stuck, we'll need to:
1. Check if SQL migration was applied correctly
2. Verify Supabase client configuration 
3. Fix session persistence between client/middleware

**Try logging in now - it should work!** 🚀

## Debug Info:
- User role: ✅ `member` 
- Redirect target: ✅ `/dashboard`
- Session issue: ❌ Middleware can't see user
- Fix: ⏰ Longer delay + full page reload
