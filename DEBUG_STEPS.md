# 🔍 STEP-BY-STEP DEBUGGING PLAN

## Current Status: 
- ✅ Login successful 
- ✅ "Redirecting to /dashboard" shows in console
- ❌ But you remain stuck on login page

## 🧪 DEBUG STEPS:

### Step 1: Check Auth State
1. **After logging in successfully**, open a new tab
2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:3000/auth-test`
3. **Look at the page** - it will show your complete authentication state
4. **Tell me what you see:**
   - Is Authenticated: Yes/No?
   - User data: What's shown?
   - Token: Present/Not present?

### Step 2: Check Middleware Logs
1. **Try logging in again**
2. **Check your terminal** (where `npm run dev` is running)
3. **Look for these messages:**
   - `Middleware dashboard check - User: [user-id] Path: /dashboard`
   - `No user found for dashboard, redirecting to login`
   - `Middleware error: [error details]`

### Step 3: Test Manual Navigation
1. **After login attempt**, manually type in URL bar:
   - `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
2. **What happens?**
   - Does it load the dashboard?
   - Does it redirect back to login?
   - Any errors in console?

## 🎯 Expected Results:

**If auth-test page shows:**
- ✅ `Is Authenticated: Yes` + User data → Auth working, middleware issue
- ❌ `Is Authenticated: No` + No user data → Auth state not persisting

**If manual navigation to /dashboard:**
- ✅ Loads dashboard → Redirect timing issue  
- ❌ Redirects to login → Middleware/session issue

## 🔧 Next Actions Based on Results:

**Scenario A: Auth working, redirect failing**
→ Fix redirect timing/method

**Scenario B: Auth not persisting** 
→ Fix session persistence

**Scenario C: Middleware blocking**
→ Fix middleware auth check

Let's start with **Step 1** - check the auth-test page! 🕵️‍♂️
